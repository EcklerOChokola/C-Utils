# C utils 

C utilities to make C more accessible modern software developers and ship :rocket:

## :star: Features :star:

This library provides simple quality of life improvements, such as:

- Golang-like error handling (with the "goerr.h" header file) :star_struck: 
- Rust\* inspired Result type (with the "rust_result.h" header file) :crab: 
- COBOL-type EVALUATE statement (with the "COBOL_EVALUATE.h" header file) :spiral_note_pad: 

## :wrench: Use :wrench:

Obviously, all these libraries can be used either separately, or by including the "libs.h" header file, which includes everything you'll need to code :zap: blazingly fast :zap: 

\*the use of the "Rust" name in this project was not endorsed by the Rust foundation, and will never be because this is an obvious shitpost, please don't sue me rustaceans
